- Alex Burgin, Samuel Goldberg, Tamás Keleti, Connor MacMahon, Xianzhi Wang  
- We investigate some problems that's related to the Erdős similarity conjecture.
- We construct a compact subset E of the real line such that zero is a Lebesgue density point of E, 
but E does not contain any (non-constant) infinite geometric progression. 
- We give some small improvements on some known related results.
- We give a sufficient condition that guarantees that a given Cantor-type set 
contains at least one infinite geometric progression with any quotient between 0 and 1, 
and this condition could be used to prove that symmetric Cantor sets of  
positive measure contain infinite geometric progressions.

- Ervin Győri, Xianzhi Wang, Zeyu Zheng
- We give a new proof of the planar Turán number of C5 and a nicer extremal construction.
- We applied "contribution method" to determine the maximal number of edges in 
a bipartite/triangle-free planar graph without small, even cycles.
